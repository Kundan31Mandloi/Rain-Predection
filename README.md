# Rain-Predection
This is a Project which gives an idea how to use Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm with Python to predict rain based on the dataset that we have.

I have Weather Data set of USA, which I downloaded from Kaggle.com. I used this dataset to predict whether there will be rain on particular day or not based on some criteria, we 
can also provide custom input and get the probability of rain based on those inputs.
